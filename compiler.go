package matrixexp

// A Compiler can transform matrix expressions by applying various optimizations
// to it, such as converting a.T().Mul(b.T()) to an appropriate call to DGEMM,
// or allowing concurrent evaluation of (a.Mul(b)).Add(c.Mul(d)) via Async.
type Compiler interface {
	// Compile transforms a matrix, or returns an error indicating a problem
	// with either the matrix expression or the compiler.
	Compile(MatrixExp) (MatrixExp, error)

	// MustCompile is just like Compile, except that instead of returning an error
	// it will panic if it encounters a problem.  It is intended for use in init()
	MustCompile(MatrixExp) MatrixExp
